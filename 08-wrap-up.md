Mercurial is a powerful tool with lots of features and options.
We have touched on the basics for day to day use.

You can learn more with:

~~~ {.bash}
$ hg help
~~~

for a list of topics,
or:

~~~ {.bash}
$ hg help some-command
~~~

for information about specific commands and their options.

TortoiseHg also has a `Help` menu that links to a documentation web site that details its features.
